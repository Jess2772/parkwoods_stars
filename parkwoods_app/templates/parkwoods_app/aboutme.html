        <p>
          I am a first-year computer science student attending the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">  University of Waterloo
            </a> in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Growing up, I had a strong passion for hockey. I played at the <a href="http://www.parkwoodshockey.com/" target="_blank">Parkwoods Hockey League</a> for eleven years, and
          I was on the select team for eight years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In high school (York Mills Collegiate Institute), I was the head of Tech Crew club, meaning I was in charge of the audiovisual aspects of performances.
          My job was to train newer members how to use the equipment and help them settle into the new
          environment, assign duties and delegate roles, and communicate with other parties to ensure a smooth and
          enjoyable event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, my interest in mathematics inspired me to become a teaching assistant at <a
            href="https://www.spiritofmath.com/" target="_blank"> Spirit of Math</a>, where I assisted younger students with their math work while promoting a positive and encouraging learning
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving back to the community is something I believe everybody should experience. For me, I thought it would be a
          great idea to share the hockey stories and skills I have gathered along the way by becoming a house league hockey coach. This opportunity allowed me to 
          give the players the best experience on and off the ice,
          just like what other coaches did for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created this website using the Python programming language and Django web framework to showcase my hockey experience. 
		      Here, you will be able to see our team's short video clips, standings/schedules and various trophy winnings. If you are registered,
          you can also create a topic and share your thoughts with others.
        </p>

          So far, university during quarantine has been an experience unique to all of us. I am hopeful and optomistic as to how life will be in 2021.
